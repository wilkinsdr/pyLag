    "## Gaussian process analysis of X-ray time lags\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the pyLag X-ray spectral timing package to perform spectral-timing analysis on unevenly sampled light curves, or light curves with gaps. We will estimate the lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra from unevenly sampled light curves by fitting a Gaussian process to the light curve in each energy band. Once the Gaussian processes have been fitted to the observed light curve data points, samples of the underlying continuous time series are drawn, and a single sample of the lag-energy spectrum is calculated from these sampled light curves. The mean lag-energy spectrum and its errors are estimated from the calculated sample. \n",

    "### Fitting the Gaussian process to a pair of light curves light curves for the lag-frequency spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to fit the Gaussian process model to each light curve we wish to use for the spectral timing analysis. We can fit a Gaussian process to a light curve using the GPLightCurve class. This class provides all of the same functionality as a standard LightCurve, but with the capability to perform the Gaussian process modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to select the Gaussian process kernel to use, which describes the autocorrelation function of the intrinsic variability. Depending on the length of the gaps in the list curves and the timescales of interest, the most appropriate options are either 'rq' (the rational quadratic kernel) or 'matern12' (the Matern-1/2 kernel), although any kernel function from scikit-learn can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose how to model the uncorrelated noise between each time bin (i.e. the Poisson noise). We can either directly use the error bars (use_errors=True) or we can add the noise term into the kernel function (noise_kernel=True). Note that these options are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also select whether to model the light curve as the log of the count rate in each time bin (lognorm=True), which may be appropriate for systems in which the variability follows a log-normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remove_nan and remove_gaps options clean up any zero-count time bins in the original light curves that may be in place of the gaps (the light curves that are passed to the Gaussian process classes should simply have the time bins missing where no data are available).\n",
    "\n",
    "The run_fit=True option will run the Gaussian process model fit for each light curve immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPLightCurve class can either read the light curve directly from a FITS file, or it can be passed an existing LightCurve object with the lc=my_lightcurve argument. This allows us to perform various operations on the light curve before fitting, such as concatenating segmetns from multiple observations into a single long light curve."
